- sound effects
    - fanfare on new streak best
    - counting?
- sorting streaks by name/count
- Hunter
    - Catching chins
        - Streak increases on "You dismantle the trap." followed immediately by "You've caught a carnivorous chinchompa."
        - Streak resets on just "You dismantle the trap."
        - Streak resets on "The box trap that you laid has collapsed."
        - Maybe want to find out how the hunter plugin is handling the coloured wheels, and increase streak on green wheels, stop on red or fallen traps
